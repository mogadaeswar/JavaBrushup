# JavaBrushup
This repository contains Java practice files and exercises as I work through learning the core concepts of the language. The code covers topics like:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts (Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, etc.), Basic syntax and control structures, Data structures (Arrays, Lists, etc.), File handling and exception handling, Algorithms and problem-solving exercises.

Structure:


Each folder contains code related to a specific topic or project. The structure is as follows:

/oOps - Practice with Object-Oriented Programming concepts

/challenge - Simple challenges on Java.


How to Use

Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/mogadaeswar/java-practice.git

Navigate to the desired folder and run the Java files:
bash --> Copy code --> javac FileName.java -->java FileName


Future Plans:
Implement more advanced Java topics like multi-threading and networking.

Add unit tests for the code using JUnit.

Create a mini-project using the skills learned.
